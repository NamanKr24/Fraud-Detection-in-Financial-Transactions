# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

In this project, I developed a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
The dataset, card_transdata.csv, contains transaction details with the target variable indicating fraud.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, scaling features, and evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
